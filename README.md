# data-structures
Data Structures is a project developed for a course assignment with the purpose of exploring various data structures. 

It stores donor information for a fictional non-profit by reading and parsing data from a CSV file and storing it in a sorted linked list. It also creates a hash table for searching by donor ID and a sorted array list to perform a binary search by last name.
